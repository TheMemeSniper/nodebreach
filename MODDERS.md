# MODDERS.md

Hello, modders! As you have (hopefully) read before, Nodebreach is essentially a script that sits on top of a bunch of files to provide a game environment.

Nodebreach doesn't really have much of a "campaign", so if you make a good enough mod for Nodebreach, try submitting a pull request! We might accept it and embed your mod in the core game.

# Terminals

Terminals in Nodebreach consist of the following:
```
Root folder - IP Address
    filesystem - Contains the files on the terminal
    manifest.txt - Contains security details on the terminal
```
